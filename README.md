An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) project refers to the development and implementation of a system that replicates the functionality of a traditional bank teller in an automated, self-service kiosk. ATMs allow users to perform various banking transactions without the need for human intervention. Here is an overview of the key components and functionalities typically involved in an ATM project
User Authentication: Verifies the user's identity through the input of a PIN or other security measures.
Account Access: Connects to the user's bank account to access balance and transaction information.
Transaction Processing: Facilitates various transactions such as cash withdrawals, deposits, fund transfers, balance inquiries, and more.
